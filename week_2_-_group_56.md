#### Meeting Organization
_Pass_

Good that there is a chair and minute taker chosen beforehand!


#### Agenda 
_Excellent_

The template is used correctly and the points are clear and consise (with good subpoints for the main talking points). Each point also has a valid time estimation.

It would be nice to also add a point where you review the action points of the past week if they were completed or not.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
_Not applicable_


#### Chair performance
_Very good_

The chair led the meeting well, taking good initiative, making sure each point was covered! Sometimes other people led conversations instead of the chair, but this only happened once or twice.


#### Attitude & Relation
_Very good_

The team took ownership of the meeting and there were usefull and good discussions. Everyone was also active and involved! A small improvement is to make sure all discussions take place in the whole group.


#### Potentially Shippable Product
_Sufficient_

You showed the current state of the application, which still was the demo project. Because there were no changes yet, I can't give feedback on this point yet. I only gave "sufficient" here as you did not add anything to the demo.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
_Good_

I think you will be well on track to equally divide tasks and features. Next week, when discussing if/what the action points of the previous week are completed, I will be able to give more feedback!
