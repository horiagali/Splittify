Perfect, clear and goes through all points and leads discussions! Keep it up like this.


#### Attitude & Relation
_Excellent_

Everyone is friendly, constructive, helping each other and taking initiative and taking issues upon yourself. You seem to be a really well working team so I have nothing to add here!!

#### Potentially Shippable Product
_Very Good_

Websockets, working server config/screen, synchroniation, and adding/deleting/editing participants. Adding expenses is not working yet, make sure that is done ASAP! Email service and settlement of debts is also working (even though you can test it on the client :)! You are slightly ahead of other groups, and I'm sure you will have a good application at the projects end!


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
_Excellent_

Very clearly went ocer the issues of the past week, and decided upon a new task distribution. This is how a good team functions, keep it up!
