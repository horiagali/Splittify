#### Meeting Organization
_Pass_

Different and chosen beforehand!

#### Agenda 
_Excellent_

Follows the template, has a sprint retrospective, and very good/usefull talking points!

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
_Excellent_

The notes are detailed and merged into the agenda correctly, which is nice to see. When reading them back later, it's clear what was discussed at the meeting and why. Altough they look a bit lengthy, the bullet points are enough to make it readable.

#### Chair performance
_Very Good_

Took good initiave in leading the meeting and made sure all topics were covered. Sometimes you could have stepped in and cut conversations short, however the meeting ended up fine so it is not an issue.

#### Attitude & Relation
_Excellent_

Once again, everyone is friendly and constructive! I saw a lot of intiaive in assigning issues upon yourself during the meeting, which is good to see and shows that you are a well functioning team!


#### Potentially Shippable Product
_Very Good_

The application looks alot more polished now! Colors, event overview, email's, filtering, deleting tags, statisitc and language features are all working! The final basic requirements need to be finished, try to do that this week! Otherwise you are on track to have a very good final application.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
_Excellent_

I feel like most action points of the previous week were achieved! The workload also seems well divided, and you are honest with each other in terms of performance! Keep it up!
