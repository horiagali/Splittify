#### Meeting Organization
_Pass_

Chosen beforehand and different people!

#### Agenda 
_Excellent_

Clear, good time-estimation and talking points! Keep it up like this!


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
_Very good_

There are some missing notes for the first points like "anouncements or approval of agenda", even if nothing is said, you can still note that down. The summary of action points is nice to see, however the formatting could be improved to make it easier to read on a later date.


#### Chair performance
_Very good_

Led the conversations well and made sure all topics were covered in a timely manner! The chair could ask people specificlally for their opinion if they are less involved in the meeting.


#### Attitude & Relation
_Very good_

Constructive meeting and friendly, good job and keep it up like this! Not everyone was equally involved in the meeting so pay attention to that the following weeks.


#### Potentially Shippable Product
_Excellent_

There are some working frontend screens and event data is already communicated to the server. There are Spring services, controllers and new common classes which is very nice to see. I think you are well on track to have a good final application!


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
_Very good_

Attention to the actions points of the past week is nice to see! The issues and tasks are divided, and everyone takes responsbility for the progress of the application. Make sure to involve people who are a little behind in the project.
