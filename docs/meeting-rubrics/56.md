#### 1) Self-organization
_Good_

The team was in charge and immediately started discussions which was nice to see. Not everyone spoke the same amount, pay attenbtion to that next week.

#### 2) Suggested Topics
_Good_

Almost all topics were covered, expect for the code of conduct template. The meeting was well moderated and discussions were structered! Read the teamwork document on Brightspace before next meeting!
