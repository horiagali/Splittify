Mark: Insufficient/Sufficient/Good/Very Good/Excellent

#### Meeting Organization
_Pass_

There was a chair/minute taker beforehand and mentioned in the agenda!

#### Agenda 
_Very good_

Was added on time, follows the template and contains clear talking points! Could add talking points to make the meeting the full 45 minutes.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
_Sufficient_

Merged into the agenda file, but sometimes could be expanded/made clearer. "We will start by adding more endpoints and front-end java code. We will look over the template and decide how to divide the tasks." This is a little vague if someone is reading the minutes a couple days after. The action points for the coming week are also not very clear or readable.


#### Chair performance
_Good_

The chair did well and made sure all topics were covered. Sometimes the chair could have been more leading, by giving conclusions to certain discussiosn and then moving on. E.g: "Okey so let's implement X by Y, and Z will do this before friday, now onto ..."


#### Attitude & Relation
_Good_

It was a good meeting, and good discussions. Make sure to keep everyone in the loop and assign conclusions to talking points before moving on, which the minute taker will note down!


#### Potentially Shippable Product
_Very Good_

You showed me the application, ran it and it looked good. I think you are on track to have a complete project at the end of the project. Make sure to work on the backend and start with Spring services.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
_very good_

The action points of last week were clearly mentioned and talked about in the meeting! I think your goals als reached well. Make sure to keep everyone in the loop. The todos for next week are also clearly divided!
