Mark: Insufficient/Sufficient/Good/Very Good/Excellent

#### Meeting Organization
_Pass_

Different and chosen beforehand!


#### Agenda 
_Excellent_

Really good that you mention the action points of the previous week and go over them 1-by-1! (and maybe rename it to sprint retrospective :). 


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
_Good_

The notes are quite short and can be a bit longer. For alot of decisions, there is no explanation why you came to that conclusion, which could be nice to have in the notes, as you might read them back and you won't remember why you decided what you did.


#### Chair performance
_Excellent_

All topics were covered in a good amount of time and led the meeting well.


#### Attitude & Relation
_Very Good_

Really good meeting, keep it up like this! Discussions on dividing tasks or deciding how/what to implement all went very well! Some people are a little quieter, try to participate in disussions anyways. Saying you agree with something is still participating, and better than not saying anything.


#### Potentially Shippable Product
_Very good_

Working language switch, creating events and expenses and communicated to the server. The admin page is also created and login is also working! Some hardcoded values and features still WIP. You are doing really well and are on track to finish before the projet end. You are also ahead of other groups, so keep it up!


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
_Very good_

Good that you discussed all the action points of the previous meeting. I feel like you did accomplish your goals and are doing well. Some people are doing a little less/more than others, so if you feel like this is the case for you, try to balance it out.
